# ESPADA - Transparency in Donations using Blockchain

ESPADA is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to bring transparency and accountability to the world of donations. With ESPADA, donors can track their donations from start to finish, ensuring that their contributions are used for their intended purpose.

## Features
### Gold-Pegged Coin:
Our personal coin, ESP, is pegged to gold at a fixed rate, ensuring stability and transparency in value.
Trackable Donations: Each coin is assigned a unique identification number, allowing donors to track its journey and see exactly how it was used.
Detailed Reports: Upon encashment of coins, donors receive detailed reports on how their donation was utilized, including the amount generated, the recipient, and the manner of utilization.
### Mitigated Inflation Risks: 
By pegging the coin to gold, we mitigate inflation risks, ensuring that the value of donations remains stable over time.
Multi-Currency Donations: Donors can donate in various currencies, with an equivalent amount of gold being converted into coins.
Revenue Generation: Businesses can partner with us under CSR initiatives, offering discounts to donors in exchange for points redeemable on their websites.
## How it Works:
### Purchase Coins: 
Donate a sum of money and receive an equivalent number of ESP coins.
### Track Journey:
Use the unique identification number to track your coin's journey.
### Receive Reports:
Upon encashment, receive detailed reports on how your donation was utilized.
### Stable Value: 
Benefit from stable coin value, pegged to gold, regardless of currency fluctuations.
## Revenue Model
ESPADA incurs costs for transactions, but we have a reliable revenue stream. By partnering with businesses and offering discounts in exchange for points, we take a cut from these companies, eliminating their consumer acquisition costs and acting as a distribution channel.
